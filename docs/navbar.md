## Overview

The Navbar adds a bottom navigation bar to the library. Tabs can open library views, folders, plugin integrations, page controls, menu actions, custom dispatcher actions, or launchable plugin menus.

## Options

- Show and arrange up to 7 visible tabs.
- Hide or show icons
- Add custom tabs with dispatcher actions, plugin menus, icons, and labels.
- Select the default tab used when the navbar opens.
- Configure Books, Home, Manga, and News tab labels or actions.
- Control active-tab styling, top border, label size, and icon size.

## Manga and News tabs

The Manga and News tabs are flexible launchers. Each one can open a dedicated plugin or jump straight to a folder of your choice.

- **Manga tab** — opens [Rakuyomi](https://github.com/tachibana-shin/rakuyomi) or any other manga reader, or opens a folder. Set the destination with **Manga tab action**, and use **Manga folder presets** to pin it to the home folder, the last folder, or the current folder.
- **News tab** — opens QuickRSS, KOReader's built-in RSS Reader (NewsDownloader), or a folder. Set the destination with **News tab action**, and use **News folder presets** for the same home/last/current shortcuts.

Folder mode makes either tab a one-tap shortcut to wherever you keep that content, even if you don't use the associated plugin.

## Grouped views

The Authors, Series, and Tags tabs group your library by metadata instead of by folder. Each grouped view keeps its own display mode, sort field, and sort direction, so you can browse Authors as a list sorted A–Z while Series stays a cover grid sorted by recently read — the settings do not bleed across views.

- **Authors** — groups books by author. Independent display mode and sort/reverse.
- **Series** — groups books by series, ordered by series position inside each group. Independent display mode and sort/reverse.
- **Tags** — groups books by tag/keyword. Independent display mode plus a global tag sort and direction.

Adjust a grouped view's display and sort from its context menu (tap and hold) while that tab is open. Changes are saved per view.
