## Stable Page Labels

Home featured widgets use KOReader page-map data when it is available. That means progress labels can show the same stable page labels used in the reader, page browser, and table of contents instead of only calculated file pages.

## Custom quotes

Override the default Zen UI quotes by editing `settings/Zen UI/quotes.lua`. Return a list of quotes; when the list is not empty it replaces the Zen UI defaults entirely. Each entry is either a `{ text, author }` table or a plain string without an author.

```lua
return {
    -- Add your quotes here. When this list is not empty, it replaces Zen UI defaults.
    -- { text = "Quote text", author = "Author" },
    -- "Plain quote without author",
}
```
